- **Content Style:** Professional, data-driven, analytical
- **Topics:** 12 WFH areas (mental health, productivity, ergonomics, etc.)

**Enhanced Master Prompt:**
```
Generate a professional Discord post about work-from-home topics using current data and research. Structure: **Bold headline** (max 12 words), 2-3 analytical paragraphs with specific statistics and metrics from 2024-2025, actionable insights for remote workers, and 2-3 authoritative source citations in format [1] <https://example.com>. Use professional tone, no emojis, focus on data-driven insights. Maximum 1200 characters including sources. Prioritize recent studies from established research institutions.
```

### Docker Configuration
**Compose Services:**
- Container: `worldsgreatestbot`
- Port mapping: 3049:3000
- Persistent volumes: ./logs/, ./data/
- Health checks with retry logic
- Auto-restart unless stopped

### Environment Configuration
**Critical Variables Set:**
- Discord: TOKEN, CLIENT_ID, channel IDs
- WhatsApp: GREEN_API credentials, group ID
- AI: All three provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity)
- Scheduling: Cron expression, timezone (Asia/Jerusalem)
- Rate Limiting: Multi-tier protection system

### MCP Integration Available
**Configured MCP Servers:**
- like-i-said-v2 (markdown processing)
- puppeteer (web automation)
- playwright-mcp (browser automation)
- perplexity-ask (API integration)
- github (repository operations)

### Current Git Status
**Modified Files:**
- docker-compose.yml
- index.js
- package-lock.json, package.json
- services/llmService.js
- services/scheduledPosts.js

**New Files:**
- services/langchainTest.js

### Performance Metrics
**Rate Limiting Configuration:**
- User cooldown: 5 seconds
- Hourly limit: 1 per user
- Burst protection: 10 notifications per 10 minutes
- WhatsApp limit: 50/hour
- Global daily limit: 500

### Recent Test Results
**AI Content Generation Sample:**
- Topic: Remote Work Career Advancement
- Statistics included: 75%, 28%, 48%, 56%
- Sources: Proper citation format

- Quality: Professional, data-driven analysis

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View dashboard
http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test Perplexity
node services/langchainTest.js
```

### Security & Best Practices
- Non-root Docker user (discordbot:nodejs)
- Environment variable isolation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Winston logging with rotation
- API key protection
- Rate limiting abuse prevention

### Next Steps Recommendations
1. Test new master prompt in production
2. Monitor content quality and engagement
3. Consider MCP integration for enhanced functionality
4. Implement formal testing suite
5. Set up monitoring alerts
